<h1> PulSort</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
PulSort is a machine learning algorithm employing neural networks written to distinguish pulsar signals from noise and radio frequency interference data. The program filters (based chi-squared test values and dispersion measure) and downloads plots generated by the software PRESTO. It then crops out two sections (the pulses of best profile section and the phase vs. frequency section) of the plot, which are fed into two separate convolutional neural networks. These networks were trained on over 5000 pieces of manually classifed data and have been 100% successful in identifying known pulsars. This code was written using Keras in Python 3.7.
